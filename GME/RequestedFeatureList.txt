//////////////////////////////// KUMAR
UI BUGS
1. Toolbar disappears
the main toolbar is non-floating. if an attempt is made to move it out of its docked position, the plugins and interpreters toolbar disappears. if the project is then closed and a new one is opened, the main toolbar is also invisible.

2. Save button on the toolbar has no tooltip. the status bar message reads "Svae Project/nSaveProject".
it should be "Save Project\nSave Project"

3. interpret can be called in six different ways, with non-uniform results

4. components toolbar is non-docking. suffers from similar invisibility bugs as the main toolbar

- It took me a while to figure out the relationship between the "DEFAULT" aspect box, the other aspect boxes, and the X & Y positions. They all work fine (as far as I know), but it's kind of confusing, especially the presence of the "DEFAULT" box. (Holly)
- When an annotation is first created, the background color in the editing window appears black, but is actually transparent in the model window. (This probably isn't an actual bug, but it is confusing.) If the background color is later switched to an actual color, there's no way to go back and make it transparent again. (Holly)
