HOWTO create the component generator application (CreateNewComponent.exe)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to tools dir, open the workspace, and compile a RELEASE version of the InterpreterConfig project
2. Run the createzipexe.bat file in the install main directory (with the main dir as current, e.g. from explorer)
	It is OK if files to be deleted are not found just before 'Creating ZIP archive' is printed
3. Compile a RELEASE version of the CreateNewComponent project. 
	Make sure CreateNewComponent.rc is recompiled  (normally it should, since createzipexe deletes its output)
4. The end product is in tools/CreateNewComponent/release/CreateNewComponent.exe





BACKGROUND
----------

The CreateNewComponent file contains a zipfile (as a resource). 
It uses this zipfile, and the info provided in tools/CreateNewComponent.lst to selectively extract files 
to the destination directory.
The zipfile is created by the createzipexe.bat.
(The ConfigureComponent.exe file is treated just as an ordinary file in this package, except that the batchfile 
copies it to the main directory from where it is generated)


To add/modify a file in the package, do not forget to add/modify it both in packagefiles.lst and in
tools/CreateNewComponent.lst. The latter file includes a flagmask: 
the first +/- indicates, whether the file is to be extracted read-only
the other +/- chars indicate, which configurations (raw, BON, legacy BON) the file is included
